    "\n",
    "Zip files are complicated, but useful. Here's a nice description I found on [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/working-zip-files-python/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> ZIP is an archive file format that supports lossless data compression. By lossless compression, we mean that the compression algorithm allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. So, a ZIP file is a single file containing one or more compressed files, offering an ideal way to make large files smaller and keep related files together.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one tricky thing is that a zip file is a _file_ but it can also contain lots of other sub-files, so it acts like a _folder_ as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Why don't we just unzip all the Wedge files and skip the unzipping? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: Because these files are *big*. We might run out of space unzipping them all. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a useful package for working with zip files called ... `zipfile`. Might be worth bookmarking the manual [page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) for it. We won't need the whole package, so we'll just import the _Class_ `ZipFile`."
