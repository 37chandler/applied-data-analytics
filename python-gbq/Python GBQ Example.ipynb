    "This notebook explores your ability to connect a Python notebook to a Google Big Query instance. *NOTE*: Before you try to run this notebook, you need to _complete_ steps 1 and 2 from this [page](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries#client-libraries-install-python). For step 2, \"Setting up Authentication\", I recommend following the console directions. Pay attention to where you save your JSON authentication file, since you'll need to tell Python how to find it. \n",
